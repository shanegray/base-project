# Typescript rules

Keep functions small and reuse code already in use

# React
Split out react components into different functions, even within the same file.
If a component would be useful for other files, create it in a separate file. Otherwise the developer will split out the component files
Use descriptive variable and function names\
Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible
