# Tailwind & ShadCn

I'm using tailwind 4 for styling and shadcn for the components.

Before you create a component, check shadcn for that component. Look in the @src/components folder

# Bun

I'm using bun for a package manager - don't use npm or pnpm for install commands

# General

If you do not know the answer to something - ask the developer
Focus on readablity when coding
Implement DRY principle (Don't repeat yourself) but not when it comes at a cost of readability
